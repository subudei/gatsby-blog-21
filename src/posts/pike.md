## Pike on lures


A roaming method will massively improve your chances of catching and will almost certainly increase the amount of fish you catch.

At this time of year, you should cover all areas of your swim strategically. Depending on the day you will sometimes need the lure to swim right past the pike’s nose before you get a take.

A solid plan when fishing canals or rivers is to cast your lure ahead of where you’re walking that way you will not spook the fish before they even see your lure.  

The beauty of lure fishing is its versatility and allows you to cover a lot of water and features. Remember that pike are very often found around features and in the margins. If you start to get takes and even catch one don’t be tempted to move, stay in the swim for a while, re-casting over the same area. Pike do group up, especially as the water gets cooler.

Pike are well known for their feeding habits and may only feed at certain times and they can also go long periods without feeding at all. Large pike is even more difficult as do not have to feed very often and spend most of their time waiting for an easy meal.

Lure fishing is the perfect method for locating the areas pike hide in and in my opinion is more effective than fishing with a dead bait for instance. It is often the case that if you offer the pike an easy meal and it will be very unlikely to resist it.


### Bring out the big lures


Many anglers are critics of huge lures but the facts are they catch pike. I know this because I have caught plenty. It is certainly one of my top tips when trying to catch pike with lures in Autumn

Firstly, big lures attract big fish. Large pike prefers larger prey; they’re less work to catch and provide a longer-lasting meal.

Another explanation as to why large lures are so effective is because the pike sees another large fish as an intruder and will attack it immediately. This is certainly the case with another pike, which is why pike lures like ‘Mike the Pike’ work so well. Big pike will not accept another pike in its territory.

An interesting thing to remember is that big lures do not only attract big fish. Jacks are fearless little buggers and will happily have a crack at a big lure.   

Perhaps because they are so visible and obvious but I suspect their strange actions trigger some predator instinct to ‘attack’.

Whatever the reason, they work and make for exciting sport!
